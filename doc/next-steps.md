# Next steps — Prepare to deploy Spring Boot app to AWS Lambda

1.  Deployment approach
   -  SAM/CloudFormation (recommended)
  
2. AWS account & deployer identity
   - "bodo" 
   - Provide target AWS `eu-central-1` and deployment method (local credentials, CI with OIDC, or assume-role).
   - Ensure deployer has permissions to create CloudFormation stacks, IAM roles, Lambda, API Gateway, S3/ECR, CloudWatch.

3. Packaging and build
   - For runtime handler: confirm `template.yml` has `Runtime`, `Handler`, and `Architectures`.
   - For container image: add a Dockerfile, build multi-arch image, push to ECR.
   - Verify `mvn package` creates a runnable artifact.

4. Artifact storage
   - Create or designate an S3 bucket for SAM artifacts (or an ECR repo for images). Grant deployer push rights.

5. IAM execution role (least privilege)
   - Create Lambda role granting only required actions (e.g., S3: GetObject/PutObject/ListBucket, CloudWatch Logs).
   - If using Secrets Manager or KMS, include `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` and `kms:Decrypt` as needed.

6. Secrets & configuration
   - Move sensitive values to AWS Secrets Manager or SSM SecureString.
   - Use environment variables for non-sensitive config; fetch secrets at runtime.

7. Networking (VPC)
   - Decide if Lambda runs in a VPC. If yes, provide subnet IDs and security group IDs and attach `AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole`.

8. Template & infra changes
   - Update `template.yml` with role/policy, environment placeholders, outputs (API URL, Lambda ARN).

9. CI/CD pipeline
   - Create pipeline to build, test, push artifacts (S3/ECR), and run `sam deploy` using a deploy role (prefer OIDC).

10. Monitoring & security
    - Enable CloudWatch Logs and set retention; optionally enable X-Ray.
    - Use least-privilege IAM policies and KMS for secret encryption.

11. Testing & validation
    - Smoke test: deploy → warm function → call endpoints → verify S3 writes and logs.
    - Add integration tests and rollback rules in CI.

What I need from you to proceed
- Deployment choice (SAM runtime vs Image)
- Target AWS region and how you will provide deploy credentials
- S3 bucket name(s) or permission to create them
- ECR repo name if using images
- Whether Lambda must run in a VPC (provide subnet/SG IDs if yes)
- ARNs or names for any Secrets Manager secrets to be used

If you confirm these items, I can: generate a production-ready `template.yml` snippet, draft the Lambda execution IAM policy, or create a sample CI workflow to build and deploy.
