# requirement 9
 the user should find all previously entered  proposed event date/time in a table to make it more human readable especially if there are lots of proposed events 

# acceptance criteria 

 * there is a column for each date , also each timespan, but all time span of the same date are grouped together so that the user can clearly see what data a timespan is refering to 
 * there is only one rows as long as no other user has entered his name and hast not yet make his choice about the events.
 * this only row start with an empty input field (where later a user can enter is name) 
 * the table should look like this: ![proposed events table](StimmabgabeTabelle.png)
 * the test should test that the event details are in a table, that the table has column headers an that the dates and timespans of all entered events are ordered from left to right
 * once the table works the still existing  Event Details on the summary page that is NOT in the table should be removed. 
 * there should be 2 header rows: the first one contains the dates and the second the time. if there are more than one timeslots on the same date then the header cell with the date should span over all the time columns in the 2nd header row that have the same date. the date therefore shows up only once for all timeslots on the same date.

  
# hints 
* this new test should NOT test all the previous steps , instead just make up a list of 3 events, 2 events on the same date but 2 different time values and one other date with a time , inject these into the `@MockBean
    private S3Client s3Client;` then call the summary page directly and check for the table 
* remember to facilitate easy access to html elements for tests use the `data-test-*` tag. Therefore the tests should access html elements, such as html-table elements primarily with those `data-test-*` tags
