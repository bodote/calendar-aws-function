description: When adding or changing JTE templates, the follow this rules:
globs: 
alwaysApply: false
---
* for `for`-loops use the `for-each` style which is more consise
* don't use the `@{ ...}` syntax, it is totally wrong, it might work with other template engines but not with jte. see [jte variables](mdc:https:/jte.gg/syntax/#variables)  instead.
